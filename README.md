## Prerequisites
* Since this is a node.js app, you will need to install node.js in your laptop.  
    * Download the latest version of node.js here --> https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
* After node.js has been installed on your machine, you will need to install npm.  
    * Follow the steps in the following website to install npm --> https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install?v=true  

Once those two prerequisites have been installed on your laptop proceed to the Installation steps
